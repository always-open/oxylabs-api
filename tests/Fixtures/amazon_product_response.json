            "content": "I have tried so many protein drinks, trying to find a protein drink that settled well in my digestive track, tasted good & doesn’t leave a bad taste in my mouth, was not at all easy. I would spend money way over my budget, from the most expensive protein drinks to the least expensive, determined to find the best protein drink. Well, it’s just me now in my older years, and I just don’t go to Costco like I used to. When I did go to Costco one time this year, while I was looking down the protein drink aisle, I nice, polite shopper, was in the same aisle looking at the Orgain protein drinks next to me. This younger, athletic looking shopper, picked up two big boxes of the Orgain, Plant Based, chocolate flavored protein drinks. He told me he tried several protein drinks that were Plant Based, and this Orgain protein drink was the best by far. He told me this protein drink is a daily routine, and he really likes it. I appreciated him sharing his thoughts with me, and he seemed so sincere and nice, offering to place the big box of Orgain in my cart for me, I decided to buy the only flavor of Orgain Costco carries, the chocolate. My favorite flavor is usually vanilla, however I did like the Orgain Chocoloate flavor & there was no after taste,no stomach problems, and one protein drink kept me full enough from early morning until close to noon that day. I found this Vanilla Bean Flavor Orgain on Amazon, ordered this several times, and I am very pleased. This is a bit over my budget, however the extra few dollars is worth it for me. I am now considering actually signing up for the monthly auto pay, to get this product each month, save money, and have it delivered regularly. I am getting older, and Amazon is making my life easier by delivering this product to me. I never ever planned on signing up for auto pay, for automatic monthly delivery for any product in my life. I just don’t do that. Well, I might change my mind with this product, since Amazon offers a better price if I sign up for auto delivery on my Prime account. I drink this once or twice a day, and I actually can say, This product is officially the only protein drink i will drink. I just hope this will always be affordable for me. I am very very happy I found a protein drink I really like.",

            "content": "Orgain Vegan Nutritional Shake is delicious and nutritious. The Sweet Vanilla Bean flavor tastes something like commercial vanilla flavored rice milk, but is a little thicker and sweeter. It's high-protein (16 grams per bottle) from all vegan sources like brown rice and chia seeds. It also contains vitamins and even fruits and vegetables. I think one of the photo views has all the nutritional info, so you can click on it to get a bigger view to see all the info. It really sticks to your ribs and keeps you going for a while between meals. The bottle is very handy; you can drink some and replace the top, and put it in the fridge for later. It's much more convenient than protein powders you have to mix with water yourself.I have a chronic health problem and a recent blood test showed I wasn't getting enough protein. I'm also not supposed to lose any more weight. Since I'm vegetarian and almost never eat eggs, this is a good way to get extra protein and other nutrients. It is sweetened with brown rice syrup and cane juice, so some people with diabetes may not be able to use it. Orgain was developed by a doctor who is a cancer survivor. When he was sick he needed to use those canned nutritional drinks, which not only tasted terrible, they were full of unhealthy ingredients like high fructose corn syrup. Orgain is not inexpensive because of its high quality, but it is worth it to me. Be aware that Orgain also has a non-vegan version made with milk protein and whey protein. It is over 99% lactose-free, but contains considerably more potassium than the vegan version (not good for people with kidney disease). The bottle looks very similar except it's green and white instead of blue and white.Since making this purchase I bought more Orgain from the Orgain company, including one pack of the Chocolate flavor. I agree with the person who wrote the most helpful critical review that the Chocolate flavor doesn't taste very good, but it's not that bad, so I'll drink them up. It just doesn't taste much like chocolate. I'll stick with the Vanilla flavor.UPDATE NOVEMBER 2014: Actually the chocolate tastes OK when chilled. The main reason for this update is the effect I believe Orgain has had on my health. I have chronic kidney disease. The way the kidney function is measured is by a waste product in the blood called creatinine. The higher the number, the worse the kidney function. In April 2013, my creatinine had gone up to 5.34, so my kidney specialist said I needed to prepare for dialysis. I felt OK, but surgery must be done to put a vascular access in your arm, since it takes 3 months for the access to be ready to use. I had the surgery in August 2013. My creatinine was fluctuating up and down; it never got as bad as 5.34 again, but the really big improvement was in August of this year. In May of this year, I was at 4.20, and then in August I was way down to 3.38, which my doctor said was \"astonishing.\" I was not doing anything different in terms of diet, exercise, or nutritional supplements EXCEPT I had started drinking an Orgain shake every day in the middle of July. I've continued to drink it every day. I just had another blood test, and I was down a tenth of a point to 3.28, which again my doctor said was \"astonishing\" and \"amazing.\" I've never had a dramatic improvement like this before. Of course I can't prove it or make any medical claims, but I think it has to be the Orgain that had made the difference.UPDATE 2016: I still recommend this shake, but with a warning for people who can't resist sweets. These do have sugar (cane juice). The chocolate ones tasted so good, especially when chilled, I got to the point where I was downing four of them a day! My blood glucose went up to 101 which is very high for me; normally it's around 70. I had to give up my beloved Orgain shakes, and my blood glucose went back down to 70.",
