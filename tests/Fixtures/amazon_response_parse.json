It is easy to use, easy to assemble.The description is well written and it works as expected.It does come with tent stakes and all you need is a rock or hammer to get them mounted into the ground. The thickness is decent, if taken care of this product appears durable and should last for a while.It does fold up into a carrying case making it easy to store and transport.This will come in handy at the beach or for anywhere that you need privacy for changing.Good investment.",

It came with the metal sticks to secure into the ground and they worked great to secure in place. The entire tent was pretty durable for the most part, although there was a strong wind that took it down one time. There was also limited ventilation inside, so definitely needed to leave a little opening for some fresh air. The whole tent itself was very lightweight and very easy to take down. This is definitely a great investment that I will be using for years to come!",

            "content": "The media could not be loaded. I'm giving this 3 stars because I bought it for $16It does bring stakes and ropes but nothing to tie the ropes to? Which means, the wind is enemy #1(see my picture). It kind of defeats the purpose of having one if it's flopped over all the time. An adult would probably be able to hold it up WHILE showering if you're an octopus but for my toddlers it was a scary ordeal. Pro: even though the wind was high enough to fold it over, it never flew away. I'm attributing that to hubby staking skills.Enemy #2 didn't realize until we went out and had to use it at night. If you have a light inside the shower and it is dark outside, it is almost see through. Not really private at all.There are also no hooks on the inside to hang a shower head (we have a camping one with a small lightweight tube)We haven't tried it in the summer yet but using hot water and a bucket method turned it into a mini sauna. A great thing in the winter but not sure in the summer.It is tall enough for my 6'4\" hubby and all sides are covered. We like that it brings a floor separate and let us decide if we need it. Folding it depends on who is doing it.We will see on durability because after one trip, the zippers giving me serious doubts.All in all for $16 and not windy conditions pretty good",

However, the material quality and folding mechanism receive mixed reviews - while some say it holds up well in bad weather, others find it flimsy, and while some say it's easy to fold, others find it difficult to collapse. Additionally, opinions on value are divided between those who find it worth the price and those who consider it not worth it.",
